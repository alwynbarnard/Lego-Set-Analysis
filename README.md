# Analysis of LEGO Set Trends and Patterns (2023)
Using Python and Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of LEGO set data to uncover market trends and product patterns. The project involved cleaning and analyzing historical LEGO set information to derive actionable insights.
Key Components:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (pandas) to handle missing values, standardize formats, and merge multiple datasets
Creation of interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends
Analysis of price points, piece counts, and theme popularity over time
Identification of seasonal release patterns and market segment targeting

Tools & Technologies:

Python (pandas, numpy) for data cleaning and initial analysis
Power BI for interactive visualization and reporting
Excel for intermediate data storage and validation

The project provided valuable insights into LEGO's product strategy and market evolution, demonstrating the power of data analytics in understanding consumer product trends.
